# 👋 What's up, **Fezio** here 🌚☝️  
### Comp-Sci undergrad • Low-level enjoyer • Coding since I shouldn't have

I'm that student who shows up already knowing half the syllabus.  
Python, Lua, Nim… and an unhealthy love for low-level work.  
Frontend? …no.  
Figma? I use it, but it knows I don’t love it.  
Organization, documentation, and project management?  
I keep them like my code, 0 warnings⚠️.

- Enjoys writing code that tickles my brain. 🧠
- Builds APIs, automation tools, UIs, whatever feels interesting that week. 🛠️
- On a love/hate relationship with Figma... 🖤
- If I enjoy it, I absorb it in O(1). Fast is an understatement. ⚡
